Plotting LD using R software

Software Required
1. R Studio
2. TASSEL Software

TASSEL Software
1.	Data Preparation:
•	Ensure your genotype data is in a compatible format for TASSEL. Common formats include HapMap or VCF.
•	Make sure your data is cleaned and filtered for quality and missing data if necessary.
2.	Open TASSEL:
•	Launch TASSEL software on your computer.
3.	Import Data:
•	Import your genotype data into TASSEL.
•	Navigate to the "Data" tab and use the import tools to load your genotype data file.
4.	Perform LD Analysis:
•	Once your data is loaded, navigate to the "LD" tab or menu in TASSEL.
•	Select the appropriate LD analysis tool. TASSEL offers various LD statistics such as r^2, D', etc.
•	Choose the parameters for LD analysis, including the window size, minimum minor allele frequency threshold, and others as per your study requirements.
5.	Run Analysis:
•	Start the LD analysis by clicking on the appropriate button or menu option.
•	TASSEL will calculate LD statistics for pairs of markers across your dataset according to the specified parameters.
6.	Extract LD File:
•	Once the LD analysis is complete, you can typically save the results in various formats including text files.
•	Look for options within the TASSEL interface to save the LD results. This may involve selecting a file format and specifying a location to save the file.
